## Description of the projects
### [Number Guessing Game](NumberGuessing)
A simple console application allowing to play a game of guessing random numbers.

The game has 5 difficulty levels differing in the range of numbers to guess, so the probability of a correct guess. The score is calculated as a percentage of correct guesses so far.

#### Technologies and elements worth noting
